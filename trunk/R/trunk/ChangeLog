	* R/textmatrix.R (textmatrix): Removed the transpose of the original
	textmatrix as k-means clustering provided by R (kmeans) now works on
	this textmatrix. The result is a k-means text clustering with a
	similarity measure based upon word frequences.

	* R/textmatrix.R: Adapted the preprocessing code from the R
	package "lsa" written by Fridolin Wild to build a document text matrix.

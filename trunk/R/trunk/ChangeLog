	* R/textdoccol.R: One can build term-document matrices if
	nessecary (with buildTDM(...)) and fill the field tdm from a text
	document collection with it.

	* R/textmatrix.R: Wrote S4 class for term-document matrices.

	* R/textdoccol.R: We now can read in a whole XML file with several
	news items.

	* R/textdoccol.R: Set up an S4 class for a collection of text
	documents. A first attempt to read in XML input (like the RCV1
	set) was made.

	* R/textdocument.R: Set up an S4 class for text documents. Wrote
	some accessor functions.

	* data/newsitem.xml: Added this XML file for testing purposes. It
	contains a single news item from the Reuters Corpus Volume 1
	(RCV1) XML set.

	* R/textmatrix.R (textmatrix): Removed the transpose of the original
	textmatrix as k-means clustering provided by R (kmeans) now works on
	this textmatrix. The result is a k-means text clustering with a
	similarity measure based upon word frequences.

	* R/textmatrix.R: Adapted the preprocessing code from the R
	package "lsa" written by Fridolin Wild to build a document text matrix.

	* Set up the R Text Mining Package infrastructure.

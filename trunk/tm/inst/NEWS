                        Dear Emacs, please make this -*-Text-*- mode!

                CHANGES IN tm VERSION 0.3-2

NEW FEATURES

    o   The functions tmFilter(), tmIndex(), tmMap() and TermDocMatrix()
        now use a MPI cluster (via the snow and Rmpi packages) if
        available. Use (de)activateCluster() to manually override
        cluster usage settings. Special thanks to Stefan Theussl for
        his constructive comments.

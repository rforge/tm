                        Dear Emacs, please make this -*-Text-*- mode!

                CHANGES IN tm VERSION 0.3-2

NEW FEATURES

    o	Weighting functions now have an Acronym slot containing
        abbreviations of the weighting functions' names. This is highly
        useful when generating tables with indications which weighting
        scheme was actually used for your experiments.

    o   The functions tmFilter(), tmIndex(), tmMap() and TermDocMatrix()
        now can use a MPI cluster (via the snow and Rmpi packages) if
        available. Use (de)activateCluster() to manually override
        cluster usage settings. Special thanks to Stefan Theussl for
        his constructive comments.

    o   The Source class receives a new Length slot. It contains the
        number of elements provided by the source (although there
        might be rare cases where the number cannot be determined in
        advance---then it should be set to zero).

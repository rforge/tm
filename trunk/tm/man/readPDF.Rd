\title{Read In a PDF Document}
\description{
  Returns a function which reads in a portable document format (PDF)
  document extracting both its text and its meta data.
}
\usage{
readPDF(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{...}{Arguments for the generator function.}
}
\details{
  Formally this function is a function generator, i.e., it returns a
  function (which reads in a text document) with a well-defined
  signature, but can access passed over arguments via lexical
  scoping. This is especially useful for reader functions for complex
  data structures which need a lot of configuration options.

  Note that this PDF reader needs both the tools \code{pdftotext} and
  \code{pdfinfo} installed and accessable on your system.
}
\value{
  A \code{function} with the signature \code{elem, language, load, id}:

  \item{elem}{A \code{list} with the two named elements \code{content}
    and \code{uri}. The first element must hold the document to
    be read in, the second element must hold a call to extract this
    document. The call is evaluated upon a request for load on demand.}
  \item{language}{A \code{character} vector giving the text's language.}
  \item{load}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether the document
    corpus should be immediately loaded into memory.}
  \item{id}{A \code{character} vector representing a unique identification
    string for the returned text document.}

  The function returns a \code{PlainTextDocument} representing the text
  and meta data in \code{content}.

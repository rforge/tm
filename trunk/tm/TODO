TODO:

* Transpose term-document matrix
  - according to Martin Maechler accessing matrix columns is faster
  - naming makes more sense (now we have documents as rows and terms as columns)

* Avoid as.matrix() call in findAssocs for sparse matrices.
  - we need a working cor() function on sparse matrices.

* Update vignette to include new features
  - removeSparseTerms()
  - Dictionary

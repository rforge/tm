      <h2>tm - Text Mining Package</h2>
      <p>
	<a href="http://tm.r-forge.r-project.org/">tm</a> provides
	a framework for text mining applications
	within <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	The tm package offers functionality for managing text
	documents, abstracts the process of document manipulation
	and eases the usage of heterogeneous text formats in
	R. The package has integrated database backend support to
	minimize memory demands. An advanced meta data management
	is implemented for collections of text documents to
	alleviate the usage of large and with meta data enriched
	document sets.
      </p>
      <p>
	With the package ships native support for handling the
	<a href="http://modnlp.berlios.de/reuters21578.html">Reuters-21578</a>
	data set, <a href="http://www.gmane.org/">Gmane</a> RSS
	feeds, e-mails, and several classic file formats (e.g.
	plain text, CSV text, or PDFs).
      </p>
      <p>
	The data structures and algorithms can be extended to fit
	custom demands, since the package is designed in a modular
	way to enable easy integration of new file formats,
	readers, transformations and filter operations.
      </p>
      <p>
	tm provides easy access to preprocessing and manipulation
	mechanisms such as whitespace removal, stemming, or
	conversion between file formats. Further a generic filter
	architecture is available in order to filter documents for
	certain criteria, or perform full text search. The package
	supports the export from document collections to
	term-document matrices, and string kernels can be easily
	constructed from text documents.
